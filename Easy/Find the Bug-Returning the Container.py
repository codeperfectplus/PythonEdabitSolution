""" The packaging system is running wild! The candy is lying loose all over in the warehouse, the cereal is missing, and bread is stuffed in a bottle. What is going on here? The candy should be in plastic and the bread should be in a bag.

The packaging machine is running the get_container() function to retrieve the container of a product. But something is not right...

Examples
get_container("Bread") ➞ "bag"

get_container("Beer") ➞ "bottle"

get_container("Candy") ➞ "plastic"

get_container("Cheese") ➞ None """

#Fix this code:
def get_container(product):
	matches = {
	"Bread" : "bag",
	"Milk" : "bottle",
	"Beer" : "bottle",
	"Eggs" : "carton",
	"Cerials" : "box",
	"Candy" : "plastic",
	"Cheese" : None
	}
	return matches[product]
